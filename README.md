## Ideas

* [x] News: blog as much as possible about new data sets
* [ ] Show all datasets in Germany: but be open for other countries
* [ ] Show apps: show apps and link them with the datasets (like in Vienna Open Data Portal)
* [ ] Show data previews: for every data set
* [ ] Show diagramms or maps: for every data set
* [ ] Add a playground: add a bin for data or visuals (like https://github.com/jsbin/jsbin/)
